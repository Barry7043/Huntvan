HuntVan is an online web application allowing multiple registered users to post their 'huntings' in Vancouver. The 'huntings' can be restaurants, caf√©s, shops, parks, sights, resorts, funs and all other interesting places that users huting in Vancouver.
There is a friend system in the web application like instagram/twitter. You can see your friends' huntings. Also, every registered user can view the entire hunting posts that hunted by the whole HuntVan community.
For unregistered toursit users, they are available to view the homepage. In homepage, there are many posts from each catogories they can see. And they can search the hutings using the search bar. But they don't have the friend system. The hunting posts can be viewed by toursit users is restricted. (They are allowed to view some portion of the whole hunting posts. Encourge the tourist users to register.)
The basic idea is kind of localized twitter/instagram that users can share all their huntings about Vancouver. So it's more like local community sharing web application.
